# foodme-backend

## About  

My website, which is currently under development, functions as a kind of recipe manager, where we can browse the recipes of delicious food. 
There are two options for finding inspiration. First on the main page, we can use the search box by filtering for a food name. Second we can check 
any food categories if we do not have a specific plan for what we want to put on the table. In addition, we have the opportunity to create our own profile,
which can be customized to our liking. Below our profile we will find our favorite dishes and some other important data, and we can also share recipes with others.

This is a learning project and my goal is to get to know better the Laravel framework and the React library. 

- I used design elements from bootsrapet and material ui
- the authentication was made easier by laravel sanctum
- data storage was solved with MySQL
- I borrowed food data (pictures, recipes, videos) from an external API called theMealDb
